# HospitalManagementSystem

This project is hospital management system and it was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.2.3. 
It is linked with the backend project "HospitalManagementSystem" in my repositories which was developed with C#. You can take a look at my backend project from here => 
[HospitalManagementSystem_Backend](https://github.com/Sevdenur/HospitalManagementSystem_Backend.git).
I spent about 40 hours developing this frontend project. Listing, adding, updating and deleting operations for patients and doctors have been successfully implemented. The listing and deletion of appointments has also been implemented successfully. The process of adding an appointment is still being worked on.
